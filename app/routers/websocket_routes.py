    ðŸ”® WebSocket Endpoint for Real-time Arcane Events ðŸ”®

    Connect to this endpoint to receive live updates about all mystical
    activities in the ArcaneOS realm. Events are broadcast in real-time
    as spells are cast, daemons are summoned, and tasks are completed.

    WebSocket URL: ws://localhost:8000/ws/events

    Event Format:
        {
            "spell_name": "summon|invoke|banish|reveal|parse|voice",
            "daemon_name": "claude|gemini|liquidmetal",

        1. Connect via WebSocket
