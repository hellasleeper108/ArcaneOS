    ðŸ”® Channel-based WebSocket Event Endpoint ðŸ”®

    Connect to this endpoint to receive real-time events on a specific channel.

        2. Receive welcome message
        3. Listen for events broadcast on that channel
        4. Automatically unsubscribed on disconnect

        - route: Navigation and routing events
        - spell: Spell casting events
