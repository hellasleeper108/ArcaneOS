# üßπ Codebase Cleanup Status

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Safe Deletions - COMPLETED

### Files Deleted (No Dependencies)

1. **‚úÖ `/app/services/veil_manager.py`** (43 lines)
   - Status: DELETED
   - Reason: Orphaned duplicate of veil functionality
   - Impact: None - was not imported anywhere

2. **‚ö†Ô∏è `/ArcaneOS/core/grimoire.py`** (37 lines ‚Üí 9 lines)
   - Status: REDUCED TO MINIMAL STUB
   - Reason: Originally thought to be unused, but `ArcaneOS/core/safety.py` imports `grimoire.GRIMOIRE_FILE`
   - Action: Recreated as minimal stub with just the constant
   - Impact: Reduced from 37 lines to 9 lines (28 lines saved)

3. **‚úÖ `/core/veil.py`** (146 lines)
   - Status: DELETED
   - Reason: **Ironically unused despite having persistence!** The simpler `/ArcaneOS/core/veil.py` is actually being used throughout the codebase
   - Impact: None - was not imported anywhere
   - Note: Had JSON file persistence but was never integrated

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Phase 2: Files Requiring Import Updates

These files cannot be safely deleted yet because they're actively imported. Need to update imports first.

### 1. `/app/services/arcane_event_bus.py` (10 lines) - SHIM

**Purpose:** Backwards-compatible shim importing from `ArcaneOS.core.event_bus`

**Current Imports (6 files):**
```python
./app/routers/websocket_routes.py:from app.services.arcane_event_bus import get_event_bus
./app/routers/spells.py:from app.services.arcane_event_bus import get_event_bus
./app/routers/compilation_routes.py:from app.services.arcane_event_bus import get_event_bus, SpellType
./app/routers/reveal_routes.py:from app.services.arcane_event_bus import get_event_bus
./app/services/daemon_voice.py:from app.services.arcane_event_bus import get_event_bus
./app/services/daemon_registry.py:from app.services.arcane_event_bus import get_event_bus
```

**Action Required:**
- [ ] Update all 6 files to import directly from `ArcaneOS.core.event_bus`
- [ ] Delete the shim file
- [ ] Run tests to verify no breakage

**Replacement:**
```python
# OLD:
from app.services.arcane_event_bus import get_event_bus, SpellType

# NEW:
from ArcaneOS.core.event_bus import get_event_bus, SpellType
```

---

### 2. `/app/services/archon_router.py` (5 lines) - SHIM

**Purpose:** Compatibility shim for legacy imports

**Current Imports (2 files):**
```python
./app/routers/spell_parser_routes.py:from app.services.archon_router import get_archon_router
./app/routers/terminal_routes.py:from app.services.archon_router import get_archon_router
```

**Action Required:**
- [ ] Update 2 files to import directly from `ArcaneOS.core.archon_router`
- [ ] Delete the shim file
- [ ] Run tests

**Replacement:**
```python
# OLD:
from app.services.archon_router import get_archon_router

# NEW:
from ArcaneOS.core.archon_router import get_archon_router
```

---

### 3. `/app/routers/reveal_routes.py` (35 lines) - MINIMAL ROUTER

**Purpose:** Single endpoint `/reveal` to disable veil

**Current Status:**
- Imported in `app/main.py` (line 21)
- Included in app (line 79)

**Current Imports:**
- Uses: `from ArcaneOS.core.veil import set_veil`
- Uses: `from app.services.arcane_event_bus import get_event_bus`

**Action Required:**
- [ ] Merge functionality into `/app/routers/veil_routes.py`
- [ ] Remove import from `app/main.py`
- [ ] Delete the file
- [ ] Run tests

**Merge Strategy:**
```python
# Add to veil_routes.py:
@router.post("/reveal")
async def reveal():
    """Disable the veil (switch to developer mode)"""
    set_veil(False)
    await get_event_bus().emit("veil_changed", {"mode": "developer"})
    return {"message": "Veil disabled"}
```

---

### 4. `/app/routers/core_veil_routes.py` (90 lines) - DUPLICATE ROUTER

**Purpose:** Veil management endpoints (DUPLICATE of `veil_routes.py`)

**Current Status:**
- **NOT** imported in `app/main.py` (good!)
- **IS** imported in `tests/test_veil.py`

**Current Test Import:**
```python
./tests/test_veil.py:from app.routers.core_veil_routes import router
```

**Action Required:**
- [ ] Update `tests/test_veil.py` to use `veil_routes.router` instead
- [ ] Verify `veil_routes.py` has all the functionality
- [ ] Delete `core_veil_routes.py`
- [ ] Run tests

**Test Update:**
```python
# OLD:
from app.routers.core_veil_routes import router

# NEW:
from app.routers.veil_routes import router
```

## üìä Summary

### Completed ‚úÖ
- Deleted 2 orphaned files (189 lines removed)
- Reduced 1 file to minimal stub (28 lines saved)
- **Total: 217 lines removed**
- ‚úÖ All imports verified working
- ‚úÖ Zero impact on functionality

### Remaining Work ‚ö†Ô∏è
- 4 files need import updates before deletion
- Total affected imports: **9 files**
- Estimated lines to remove: **140 lines**

### Next Steps
1. Update imports in 6 files (arcane_event_bus)
2. Update imports in 2 files (archon_router)
3. Merge reveal_routes into veil_routes
4. Update test file to use veil_routes
5. Delete 4 shim/duplicate files
6. Run full test suite

## üîç Discovery: Veil Implementation Confusion

**Interesting Finding:**
The analysis identified `/core/veil.py` as the "authoritative" version because it had JSON persistence, but in reality:

- `/core/veil.py` (146 lines, JSON persistence) = **NOT USED ANYWHERE**
- `/ArcaneOS/core/veil.py` (42 lines, in-memory only) = **ACTIVELY USED**

This suggests an incomplete migration where the simpler ArcaneOS version was adopted over the more feature-rich root version. The root version's persistence feature was never integrated.

**Recommendation:** If persistence is needed in the future, port it to the ArcaneOS version.
